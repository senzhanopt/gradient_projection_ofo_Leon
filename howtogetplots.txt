to get the data from the paper: 
for fig. 4 & 5 run with:
alpha = [0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5]
delay = [0] 
cs = [100] 
static_start_pos = 0 
noise = 0
noise_matrices = 0

for fig. 7:
alpha = [0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5] #a = 0.5 gives problems from delay = 2 already, at delay = 3 only a = 0.1 and 0.2 run without error message "no optimal solution found"
delay = [0] #delay representing communication delay of measurements/control. 
cs = [2] #gradient descent steps per timestep

steps = 96 #amount of timesteps 96 is one day
week_offset = 18 #week 18 is in the middle of spring
offset = week_offset*672 #offset for timesteps -> determines which week we choose for generation/load profiles every week is 672 timesteps
noise = 0
